# Galaxy Generator (GG)
Interactive installation

In a time where science dissipates mystical theories about Universe, new questions arise as humans go deeper in extending their conceivable realities. What is my relation to the Universe? Does the Universe define me, or do I define the Universe? Are we even asking the right questions?


‘Galaxy Generator’ is a space-flavoured experience which is powered by human interaction. Visitors can activate galaxy creation processes through movement and are invited to discover the forces that influence its creation. Technically each galaxy created will have unique, unrepeatable traces and will be malleable for a short time before freezing in a permanent state.

How far can one understand the rules of the game and try to bend them to his will? Does the movements influence the creation of the players Galaxy, or does the Galaxy dictate the movements of the player? The hint to the players “Good Game” might suggest that in the end, independent of the outcome, the game was well played.
